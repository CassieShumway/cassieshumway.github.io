<h1>Simplicity</h1>

<p>You know that phrase, “Less is more?” Well in terms of design, simplicity can be a beautiful thing. Comparable to wireframes, the layout needs to be successful without relying on color or images. So by keeping your design simple, you have the purity of layout, usability, and navigation. Resulting in no distractions and no unnecessary accents. Therefore, every element you place on the page has reason and functionality.

<h3>Starting Off</h3>

<p>For this project, I was given an assignment with the topic of Chicago Doughnuts. As a requirement, the user must have the ability to view menus from several Chicago based doughnut stores. The requirements for the project required clear heirarchy, clean layout, and custom illustrations and/or icons.</p>

<h3>Keeping It In Check</h3>
<p>By looking at the wireframe and the mock-up...you can already see some big differences between them. You should know that this is a <em>bad thing</em> unless it was approved by your client!</p> 

<p class="bold-text">Never change a design last minute or without permission from the client.</p>

<p>It's good to know that you don't want to waste your client's time or mislead them. There are important notes to remember when you present a wireframe and it gets approved. First off, <em>that</em> is the design that was accepted and agreed upon. Second, the client most likely will become attached to the original wireframe and will be unsettled seeing another concept out of the blue. Lastly, you don't want to waste the clients time or money going rogue.

<h3>Defend Yourself</h3>

<p>There will be plenty of situations where a client might fight you on your decisions. Pick your battles carefully but also know how to defend your design.</p>

<p>Here are some scenarios: 
	<ol class="margin-bottom">
		<li>A client might not know why certain elements are in the layout.</li>
		<li>A client might not understand the best use for navigation flow.</li>
		<li>A client might just have really bad taste.</li>
	</ol>
<p>With all of this said, it's your job to be able to help guide the client in the right direction and defend your position.</p>

<p>It was interesting to hear Mike Jansen ask questions regarding my design choice. All valid questions which I should always be able to explain. Questions such as “Why had I used that particular shape?” “Why had I used that font?” “What was the reasoning behind my color scheme?” Always be prepared to any any and all questions your client might have about <em>every</em> design decision.</p>

<h3>Review Your Design &amp; Code</h3>

<p>Before presenting any project to a client, take the time to step back. Take a breather, walk around, or sleep on it. Everything looks different when you allow yourself a break from staring at something for 12 hours straight.</p>

<p>Come back to your computer screen with fresh eyes and review your design and code. It's easy to miss small mistakes, overlook extra spacing....and to pile on unneccesary elements when you're a zombie. Take a break! Allow yourself to see things as they are, make good decisions, and keep things simple!</p>
