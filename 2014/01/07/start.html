<h1>The Start</h1>
<h2>"Would you be able to start your Novice Apprenticeship?"</h2>

<p>This is just part of what Adam emailed to me before I had to take a moment before reading on. The chance to learn from 8th light was an opportunity I was more than happy to take. The thought of being challenged to learn and grow is something that I've been looking forward to. Most people don't enjoy the struggles and all-nighters...but I love that "Aha!" moment...even if you just spent 8 hours on something that could've been fixed in 5 seconds. Regardless, its been so satisfying to work towards a goal and have a mentor care about the quality of your work.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to being challenged and developing skill sets where I can contribute to projects and approach them with the best code practices!</p>

<p>Prepare for full throttle on January 22nd.</p>
