<h1>Color Theory</h1>

<p>Color can dramatically affect moods, feelings, and emotions, becoming a powerful tool in design. Learning to understand color can improve marketing to the correct audience. Through the use of color theory, we can better communicate and express the moods and feelings we want to show in our designs. Also, think back on our typography principles; they are the same!</p>

<h3>What is color?</h3>
<p>It all started with Sir Isaac Newton in 1666. He discovered colors were made up of a single wavelength and couldn't be seperated any further. How? By passing pure white light through a prism which seperated all the colors.</p>

<div class="box"><img class="image" src="/images/isaacnewton.jpg" /></div>

<p>Through further experimentation, he discovered that the light could be combined with other colors to create new ones. For example, red light mixed with yellow light created an orange color. He was the first to understand the rainbow. At the time, it was thought that color was a mixture of light and darkness and that prisms <em>colored</em> light <a class="underline" href="http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/bh.html">(color vision &amp; art).</a></p>

<h3>Primary Colors</h3>
<p>There are three primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. These main colors create all other colors on the spectrum. However, primary colors cannot be created by other colors.</p>

<h3>Secondary Colors</h3>
<p>There are three secondary colors: orange, purple, and green. These secondary colors are created by mixing the primary colors.</p>

<h3>Tertiary Colors</h3>
<p>There are many combination colors that come from mixing primary and secondary colors. These include yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green and yellow-green.</p>

<h3>Effects of Color</h3>
<p>All colors are subjective to the viewer based on their background, culture, and personal experience. However, some colors have a universal effect and meaning.</p>

<h3>Color on the Web</h3>
<p>Taking what we know about colors, we can attribute the same feelings on the web. Lets take a look at how red and yellow might have different meanings.</p>

<div class="box">
	<img class="image" src="/images/warning.png" />
	<p>1. Yellow used as a caution sign</p>
</div>

<p>1. Here we see red and yellow as warning signs. Typically we see yellow on construction sites as warnings or caution. Here you can see that they've attributed the same meaning, but online. Furthermore, by adding red we see a stark and jolting contrast that screams “Caution!” to warn the user.</p>

<div class="box">
	<img class="image" src="/images/yellow-ad.jpg" />
	<p>2. Yellow used for a button</p>
</div>

<p>2. Here we see yellow as something bright with high energy screaming “Sell Now!” to the user. Yellow is typically used for ads and marketing because it grabs people's attention but is a friendly color as not to scare them away. In terms of using it as a button, its bright color helps direct the user to click on it.</p>

<h3>Reminder</h3>
<p>Don't forget that successfully using color theory requires awareness of color meaning. To be successful in your design, keep in mind the associations color has culturally and naturally. Then proceed to improve your design!</p>
