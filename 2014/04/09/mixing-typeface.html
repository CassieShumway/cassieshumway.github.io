<h1>Typeface Basics</h1>

<p>The following blog post will go through some typography basics to help you make better design choices. These design choices also improve fuctionality by making things more readable and functional. Since the subject of typography is so vast, we will focus on the uses of typeface in this post.</p>

<h3>Font v.s Typeface</h3>
<p>First off, let's distinguish the difference between a font and a typeface.</p>

<h4>Typeface</h4>
<p>A typeface is the look and style of the type design. Each typeface has a name, such as Helvetica, and is a family of fonts.</p>

<p class="half-margin-bottom">So for Helvetica, you have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Helvetica Regular</li>
  <li>Helvetica Italic</li>
  <li>Helvetica Bold</li>
  <li>......etc</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a family of fonts and is a typeface. </p>

<h4>Font</h4>
<p>A font is a digital representation of a typeface and is <em>one</em> specific weight/style within a typeface family.</p>

<p>For example: Helvetica Italic is a font.</p>

<h3>Mixing Typefaces</h3>

<p>The best advice I could give you when you're starting to mix typefaces, is to keep things simple. But here are some main points to help guide you on your way.</p>

<h4>1. Pick Twins</h4>
<p>Its hard looking through all the options online...there are so many typefaces that it can be overwhelming. But fear not, there is an easy and safe approach! Look for <span class="pink-text">typeface families that offer both serif and sans-serif characters</span> (called "twins"). By doing this, you maintain compatibility and effortlessly mix two typefaces.</p>

<hr class="divider-short" /> 

<h4>2. Sans + Sans Serif</h4>
<p>Want an easy option for mixing two typefaces? Use a sans serif + serif combination! Try keeping a classic heading with a neutral body typeface.</p>

<p>If you decide to use a typeface with a lot of personality then be sure to keep other typefaces neutral to avoid any clashing.</p>

<ul>
  <li class="feather-image">Don't pair two slab serifs together.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Slab serifs will overshadow others.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Don't mix the moods of your typefaces.</li>
</ul> 

<p>An example of clashing typefaces:</p>

<div class="font-example">
  <div class="font-example-inner">
    <p class="font-fugaz">FUGAZ TYPEFACE</p>
    <hr class="font-example-hr" />
    <p class="font-cinzel-bold half-margin-bottom">CINZEL TYPEFACE</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="divider-short" /> 

<h4>3. Stay Within The Family</h4>
<p>If mixing typefaces scare you, simply choose a typeface that has several different styles and weights. By doing this, you can have structure <em>and</em> beauty, all while staying within the same typeface!</p>  

<div class="font-example">
  <div class="font-example-inner">
    <p class="font-roboto-bold">ROBOTO TYPEFACE</p>
    <p class="font-roboto-light remove-margin-bottom">This light weight 300 Roboto typeface works well with its heavier 700 weight as a headline. By using different weights, you can vary your typeface to give visual hierarchy.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<ul>
  <li class="feather-image">Try mixing in bolds and italics within the same typeface.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Use different point sizes and weights.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="divider-short" /> 

<h4>4. Think About The Details</h4>
<p>Try sticking to two typefaces that have similar x-heights, shape, and proportions. Be sure to consider the mood and personality of each font to create the right feel you want.</p>

<hr class="divider-short" />

<h3>Heirarchy</h3>
<p>Be sure to always use heirarchy so you can clearly identify each element. Assign a role to each font/typeface and stick to it! By using varying sizes and font weights, you can better direct readers.</p>

<p>For example, clearing defining a title, headline, and body text:</p>

<div class="font-example">
  <div class="font-example-inner">
    <p class="font-roboto-bold">TITLE</p>
    <p class="font-roboto-italic">This is a headline</p>
    <p class="font-roboto-light">This light weight 300 Roboto typeface works well with its heavier 700 weight as a headline. By using different weights, you can vary your typeface to give visual hierarchy.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Font Weight</h3>
<p>Knowing what we just learned about hierarchy, now is a good time to introduce font weight. Remember how we increased the weight to make our headline? Use different font weights to give some visual hierarchy and direction. 

<ul>
  <li class="feather-image font-roboto-light">Font weight 300</li>
  <li class="feather-image font-roboto-normal">Font weight 400</li>
  <li class="feather-image font-roboto-bold">Font weight 700</li>
</ul>

<hr class="divider-short" /> 

<h3>Personalities</h3>
<p>In his article "Best Practices of Combining Typefaces," Douglas Bonneville lists some personalities that different typefaces have. I thought it would be neat to read through and see how typefaces can be described with different personalities.</p>

<p>Each typeface has their own character:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="feather-image">Rockwell: Known for attention getting headlines</li>
  <li class="feather-image">New Baskerville: A versatile transitional serif typeface. Has wide glyphs that would work well with a heavy set typeface that helps off-balance it.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Clarendon Bold: Being a slab serif, they have distinct personality.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Franklin Gothic Bold: Stoic, sturdy, strong but with a sense of elegance.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Souvenir: Playful, casual, and pretty.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Futura Bold: Has high x-heights, wide glyphs and very circular letter shapes. </li>
  <li class="feather-image">Dax: Modern, savvy and bright</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Bell Gothic: Dynamic and outspoken.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Bernhard Modern: Classy, quiet, and sophisticated.</li>
  <li class="feather-image">Caslong: Old style typeface but modernized to be a nice neutral choice.</li>
</ul>
