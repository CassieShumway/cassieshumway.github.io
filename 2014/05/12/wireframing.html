<h1>Wireframing</h1>

<p>Wireframing is an important start to any web design project. Think of it as a blueprint for your website. There are no colors, graphics, or any sort of styling since the priority is on functionality. Strictly speaking, we want to focus on prioritizing content, user experience, and practicality of a design concept.</p>

<hr class="divider-short" />

<blockquote>“It primarily allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>—Winnie Lim</blockquote>

<hr class="divider-short" />

<p>Its neat to see that there is a correlation between wireframing and graphic design. In graphic design, your design should be successful in black and white, regardless of color. On that same note, Lim mentions that users should be able to navigate on a black and white wireframe without color. If users aren't able to navigate on the most basic level, then the results wont be any different if you added color.</p>

<h3>Helping Both you &amp; the Client</h3>

<p>Creating wireframes is not only important for you but for your client as well. By sticking to rough sketches, you're helping both parties direct their attention on what's really important —without wasting time.</p>

<h4>For You</h4>

<p>Dont waste time on anything more than low fidelity sketches. Allow yourself to set the foundation first then spend time on revisions. Otherwise you'll end up wasting your time along with your clients time <em>and</em> money. Try making a few sketches (at least three) and presenting them to the client. After getting their feedback, you'll know if you're headed in the right direction or not.</p>

<p>Remember: There will <em>always</em> be revisions. But catching the mistakes early on will allow you to move onto the next process without making heavy changes.</p>

<h4>For the Client</h4>

<p>When you provide anything more than a rough sketch to a client, a lot of assumptions can be made. It's very easy for a client to become distracted by color and be swayed. The company 45 Royale gives a great example if you happen to select an overall green color scheme for your page and your client happens to hate the color green. They're likely to have more of an emotional response and be distracted from the actual layout of the page:</p>

<hr class="divider-short" />

<blockquote>“Their feedback may be, “You need to completely start over” when in actuality, the layout works fine and the color was the only thing throwing them off.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>—45 Royale</blockquote>

<hr class="divider-short" />

<p>Another great aspect of wireframing is the ability to learn your client's preferences and tastes. If you notice throughout the design process that your client is consistenly commenting on using smaller elements...Then you should probably note that your client doesn't like large bulky elements and aim for a lighter touch in your design.</p>

<h3>Tools You Can Use</h3>

<h4>1. Paper and Pen</h4>

<p>You can't go wrong with this cost efficient, fast and immediate approach. This is a great way to hash out ideas, brainstorm, and discuss with your team.</p>

<h4>2. Illustrator</h4>

<p>Personally, I love Illustrator. I'm very comfortable with the program which allows me to work quickly and efficiently. Thankfully, this is a great tool that designers can use as a wireframing tool. Its easy to move, scale, modify, and duplicate any object. Another bonus, is that its easy to export any files to Photoshop when needed.

<h4>3. Balsamiq</h4>

<p>A popular wireframing tool that's still new to me. During my free trial of Balsamiq, I was able to play around with the tools and make quick easy layouts. I found it incredibly easy to use and loved the low-fidelity designs. It forces you to really concentrate on the usability of your layout without all the distraction of styling.</p>

<h3>Remember!</h3>

<p>Don't forget! A wireframe is a <em>sketch</em> and draft of a layout idea. Keep your focus on making a successful framework that focuses on usability and content. If your layout doesn't work, then no amount of color or styling will fix it! If a client happens to ask for more visual design, stand your ground and establish the ground work before moving on. There's no point in spending time on graphics before the information design is complete because the design direction could always change.</p>

<p>Maintain flexibility! You will make many iterations in order to narrow down the best layout of information. So slowly work up to the final draft before worrying about the styling. </p>
